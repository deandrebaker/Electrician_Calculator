The Electrician Calculator is a Java application used to assist electricians with calculating electrical quantities. This includes quantities such as voltage, current, resistance, and capacitance in both series and parallel circuits. The app allows the user to save calculated values and use them in other calculations. This app is helpful for beginner circuit designers who are learning to design electronic circuits using electronic components such as batteries, resistors, and integrated circuits.
